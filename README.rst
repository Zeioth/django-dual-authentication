This package allows to authenticate a user with either a username an
email address, or both. It overrides
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ authenticate method, so it
should work in almost any case of use, without touch anything else.

Supported versions:

-  Python >= 2.7
-  Django >= 1.5

Installation
------------

Run

::

    pip install django-dual-authentication

Then, add this line to your settings.py

::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ['django-dual-authentication.backends.DualAuthentication']

Quick and painless, right?

Settings
--------

-  ``AUTHENTICATION_METHOD``: You can authenticate your users by
   ``'username'``, ``'email'``, ``'both'``. Default: ``'both'``.
-  ``AUTHENTICATION_CASE_SENSITIVE``: You can choose ``'username'``,
   ``'email'``, ``'both'``, ``'none'``. Default: ``'both'``.

Please note that if you combine certain options like
``AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'username'`` and
``AUTHENTICATION_CASE_SENSITIVE = 'username'``, then might be a good
idea check if a not case sensitive user already exists, for your
registation form's username field. Other way, users having the same
username with different capital letters, will not be able to login, for
obvious reasons.

Common issues
-------------

We've been reported about users having problems with MySQL and
dual-authentication case sensitive option. This is because `mysql is
case-insensitive by
default <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/databases/#collation-settings>`__.
So, if you need case sensitive authentication, probably you'd prefer
avoid this database engine.
